Fully connected layers are an essential component of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have been proven very successful in recognizing and classifying images for computer vision. The CNN process begins with convolution and pooling, breaking down the image into features, and analyzing them independently. The result of this process feeds into a fully connected neural network structure that drives the final classification decision.
The work on MNIST dataset has been done in the Python File to create a Single-Layer as well as Multi-Layer Network.
